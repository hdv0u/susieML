# susieML
does uhh detect Susie

## Overview
susieML is a CPU-based ML that utilizes image input for training and testing.
It can be tested with a live-detection screen(for now, no camera support)

## Features
- Optimized for CPU processing
- Folder-level batch processing
- Real-time character detection(mss)
- Very flexible with character detection
   - Can be used to detect other characters other than Susie(default)

## Disclaimer
This project is a fan-made passion project that explores PyTorch, ML, and dsand00's 'My Ghost friend'.
All artwork belongs to the respective creator/s.

## Future Plans
- Optimize CPU-only FPS
- Improve generalization on fanart(if CCE/multi-class)
- Enlarge training data set
- fix save PATH thingy
