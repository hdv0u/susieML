does uhh detect Susie

## Overview
susieML is a CPU-focused ML that do ML things like train and detect.
It can be tested with a live-detection screen(for now, no camera support)

## Features

- Real-time character detection(mss)
- Very flexible with character detection
   - Can be used to detect other characters other than Susie(default)

All artwork belongs to the respective creator/s.

## Future Plans
- Optimize CPU-only FPS
- Improve generalization on fanart(if CCE/multi-class)
- Enlarge training data set
